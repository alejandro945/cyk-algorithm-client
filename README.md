# :books: CYK Algorithm for CFG in CNF :books:

## Algorithm :pencil:
The CYK algorithm is a decision algorithm for CFG (context-free grammar) in CNF (Chomsky normal form). This determines whether or not give string of length n is generated by a CFG. The algorithm is applied by filling a table with n rows and n columns. The pseudocode is:

### -Input: 
A grammar G in CNF and a string of n terminals w = a1,a2 ... an.

### -Initialize:
j=1. For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n,

Xij = Xi1: set of variables A such that **A -> ai** is a production of G.
  
### -Repeat:
j = j + 1. For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n-j+1 

Xij = set of variables A such that **A -> BC** is a production of G, with B ∈ Xik and C ∈ Xi+k,j-k, considering all k such that 1 ≤ k < j - 1.
  
### -Until: 
j=n.

### -Output: 
w ∈ L(G) if and only if S ∈ X1n.
